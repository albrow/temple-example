## Demo

A [Live Demo](http://d3cqowlbjfdjrm.cloudfront.net/) of the application is
available online.

## Implementation

[GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) compiles go to javascript code
which can run in the browser. [Humble](https://github.com/go-humble/humble) is
a collection of tools written in go designed to be compatible with GopherJS.

The following Humble packages are used:

- [router](https://github.com/go-humble/router) for handling the `/active` and
	`/completed` routes.
- [locstor](https://github.com/go-humble/locstor) for saving todos to
	localStorage.
- [temple](https://github.com/go-humble/temple) for managing go templates and
	packaging them so they can run in the browser.
- [view](https://github.com/go-humble/view) for organizing views, doing basic
	DOM manipulation, and delegating events.

The full TodoMVC spec is implemented, including routes.

### Getting up and Running

First, [install go](https://golang.org/dl/). You will also need to setup your
[go workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). It is important that you have
an environment variable called `GOPATH` which points to the directory where all
your go code resides.

To download and install this repository, run
`go get github.com/go-humble/examples`, which will place the project in
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/go-humble/examples` on your machine.

You will also need to install GopherJS with
`go get -u github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs`. The `-u` flag gets the latest version,
which is recommended.

Then run `go generate ./...` to compile the templates and compile the go code
to javascript.

Finally, serve the project directory with `go run serve.go` and visit
[localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
